          <h3 class="section-heading" >Childhood</h3>

          <p style="text-align:left;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child i was always fascinated by wheels and their power to transport people from one place to another,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When i was 11 i built a car out of Ice cream sticks,glue and
            some bobbins for wheels, i added a small toy motor in the front hood made out of ice cream sticks too, and a drive shaft made out of a pen,it was completed and it worked, i was ecstatic! I was so happy i wanted to build a bigger version of
            the same car, i built a 1:8 scale model car made out of window pane wood, it had two motors for each wheel, My dad had Bought me a copy of “electronics for you” magazine that month it had an article about something called an arduino board,
            they were cheap and were available near me, we bought one of those and i studied about it and tinkered with it until i was ready to put it in my car that i had build. I used it to control both my motors in my very first electric car, even
            though it was a toy, it was electric,it had so much instant power and it was easier to maintain and reprogram too.<br>
            <h3 class="section-heading" style="margin-top:40px;">First ICE Motorcycle </h3><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated High-school that year, and my dad bought me an 100cc bike to commute to and fro from the college.that was the first time i had a feel for internal combustion engines, They seemed so powerless and slow
            to accelerate and i did not have any control, it did not have any electronics, you had to throttle it until it reached some specific range limit until you could do something with that bike, until that there would be no power and no speed.
            I wanted more.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always wanted to build a bike,and during that time i was fascinated by cafe racers, people used to take their old bikes and build cafe racers out of them and they looked cool, i wanted to build
            one too.but i did not have the money and the bike was still in it’s warranty period, i couldn't do anything to it.<br>
            <h3 class="section-heading" style="margin-top:40px;text-align:left;">Entry into The Electric Vehicle world</h3><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then i entered College in 2014, in my second year, there was an electric vehicle building competition called the SAE EFFIcar, it was a competition to build avery efficient 2 seater electric car and d participate
            in an endurance race, And i got selected in it among 12 others from our college<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were very ambitious, we were the only team to use lithium ion batteries and a BMS system in the competition, all other competitors
            used Lead acid or any other means because they thought they were more reliable and easier to control.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We built our car, went to the competition, completed a all the preliminary rounds, and during the endurance
            race, we finished 14 laps and then there was a critical problem in our BMS, there was a loose connection in our batteries and the BMS shut off and wont switch on again, we couldn't go on any longer, We came 11th .<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            That was our first failure. We failed at endurance, we couldn't even finish the race.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            <h3 class="section-heading" style="margin-top:40px;text-align:left;">The Idea For an High-range Electric Superbike Began </h3><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One year later, i had an idea to build a motorcycle that could have the highest range the world has ever seem for that performance segment and wouldn't have any reliability issues that we faced in our competition
            before.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started reading all about Motorcycles, how their frame is built every thing from geometry of a motorbike to its final handling graphs, after that i got a friend from Automobile department in our college,
            he started working on the frame and the body, analysing each and everything as the process went along, i and a few buddies from The robotics branch of our college started working on the battery and electronics, we build small packs, tested
            them, built a BMS, used quite a few controllers just to monitor all the parameters of individual cells in a battery pack, We did not want to repeat the same mistake again, we wanted to build a very reliable BMS system which had redundancy
            and many other nifty features to protect the user and the not to interrupt the ride and shutting down without notice, we wanted a completely redundant system. We built a small pack tested it, and it worked flawlessly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Then we were did all the necessary calculations to scale up everything we had done, We did computer simulations, and some intense testing to calculate what range we would get at certain conditions This is how we came up with All the range
            numbers and the speed numbers that we have claimed in our website.<br><br>And thus the concept was born. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need Financial help to build this concept and prove that This is possible.<br><br> Thank you<br><br><span style="font-size:13px">Swapnil Mankame<br>Founder | Mankame Automotive<span>
